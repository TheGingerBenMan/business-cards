## Documentation for Business Card Project

This site is the result of my "business card project" from the Web Typography class at UMass Dartmouth. It was my first exposure to code, so understandably it was quite the endeavor. Despite getting to a final result that works and looks fairly good, I still do not fully understand what I am doing. Yet I know significantly more about HTML and CSS than I did before (which was nothing). I used starter code from my professor as a base, and moved on from there. I had all my ideas from the start and achieved most of them. For future reference, I will likely not being using starting code as my main document, because I ended up mashing code together early on in a way that is very jumbled. Instead, I would only take code that I know I need, to prevent use of un-needed code and confusion.

My biggest challenge was making the card flip. I had no idea how to achieve it, but after a lot of work and grief I was able to make it work. A friend from a previous college assisted me on reorganizing the code, as prior to that only one side of the card flipped.

I referenced the code from this tutorial -> https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_flip_card

There are still some very minor errors and things I'd like to add, but overall, I am very content with the product I ended up at. This is my very first project using any form of coding, and I learned a lot from it.
